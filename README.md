# EBSI Command Line Interface

The EBSI CLI is a Command Line Interface to connect and test some of the EBSI Core Services provided on the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI).

IMPORTANT REMARKS: EBSI CLI is a sample code to help Early Adopters (EA), this is not perfect code (nor audited code) but we share it in beta version to help EA better understanding through real User Code, how to consume EBSI Core Services.
